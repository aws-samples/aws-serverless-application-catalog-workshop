# Creating a Sample Application

In this section we'll create our first Serverless application using AWS SAM CLI `sam init` command. The Cloud9 environment we just created already comes up with AWS CLI, AWS SAM CLI and other dependencies installed to our usage.

{{% notice note %}}
The idea behind this whole module is to create and package an initial application containing a boilerplate code with meaningful content and information that our development teams will use as a starting point for each new Serverless application they start from scratch.
