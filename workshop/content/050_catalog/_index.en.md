# Packaging and Distributing the Pipeline

We are now going to package our application code and transform the CI/CD pipeline we just create in a reusable product avaible across all our developer teams in our organization using a AWS CloudFormation template and AWS Service Catalog.

{{% notice note %}}
The idea behind this whole module is to create and package an initial application containing a boilerplate code with meaningful content and information that our development teams will use as a starting point for each new Serverless application they start from scratch.
