# Serverless Application Catalog Workshop

Welcome! In this workshop, we will explore some of the ways you can implement a CI/CD pipeline on AWS for Serverless workloads in a standardized way across an entire organization, allowing Software Engineers to develop and test Serverless workloads as they would in a more traditional environment while DevOps teams can focus on building one single pipeline that satisfies multiple environments and can be distributed as a "product" across multiple development teams.
