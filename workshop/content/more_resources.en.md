* [Monolith to Serverless SaaS Workshop](https://decompose-monolith.serverlessworkshops.io/) In this workshop, we’ll start with a traditional monolithic architecture for a working sample application. Then, we’ll progressively migrate the elements of the single-tenant monolithic architecture to a modern multi-tenant solution. This will include moving to a modern web application, introducing the API Gateway, decomposing the application tier into serverless microservices.
